### Description:

This is a project designed to act as an exhibit for data leakage and/or methods against it. The main reason I coose to do is because, for all the times we are told of leakage's dangers we are never shown them in action as with problems in other fields. I also wanted to provide proof as to the legitimacy of all the precautions against it by citing the diffences in performance when certain precaution are ignored.
